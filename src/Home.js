        <p>Valentine's Day is the Holiday of Romance. Romance is love in its active state, 
		ignited and inspired. Valentine's Day may feel like a holiday forced 
		on us by the Greeting Card, Jewelry and Floral industries, but the truth 
		is that we have accepted it because we recognize and value its purpose. 
		Love that never inspires romance is stagnant and stale. Valentine's Day 
		is an opportunity to ignite our existing relationship with romance, and 
		love with an added dose of romance will result in a stronger, longer lasting 
		and far more satisfying relationship.</p>
